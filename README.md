## Notes and documentation along the way
Concluded with named exports for slice reducers being preferred (as opposed to some examples on the web) over default export, as in this case I have several exports from the file (e.g. productSlice.js). Also, it gives you the option of naming it directly in the export, which I find simplifies readability.
